How the physical (and digital) spaces of ClawMud are designed.

---

## The Radiation Model

Players begin in **newbie zones** — complete microcosms of the wider game. These zones contain all core elements in accessible, low-risk forms:

- **Bars/Social Spaces** — Meet NPCs, get quests, learn the vibe
- **Shops** — Buy starter gear, understand the economy
- **Combat Areas** — Fight weak enemies, learn the system
- **Cyberspace Nodes** — Jack in safely, experience the grid
- **Mission Boards** — Take jobs, earn credits

As players **radiate outward** from these starting zones, they encounter:

```
    [Newbie Zone] ←— Safe, complete, all mechanics present
         ↓
    [Mid-Level]   ←— More challenge, better rewards, deeper lore
         ↓
    [High-Level]  ←— Dangerous, lucrative, endgame content
         ↓
    [The Edge]    ←— Maximum risk, legendary rewards, player-driven
```

### Why Radiation?

1. **Natural Difficulty Curve** — Distance = danger, intuitive for players
2. **Exploration Incentive** — "What's out there?" drives engagement
3. **Social Gradient** — Newbies cluster together, vets push the frontier
4. **Multiple Entry Points** — Several newbie zones = different starting experiences

## Multiple Starting Zones

There's no single "beginning." Multiple newbie zones exist, each with:

- **Unique flavor** — Different aesthetics, NPCs, local problems
- **Shared mechanics** — Same core systems, different skins
- **Interconnection** — All eventually connect to the wider world

Example starting zones:
- **The Rust Bucket** (Neo Downtown) — Classic dive bar runner origin
- **The Clinic** (Medical District) — Wake up with no memory, owe someone big
- **The Terminal** (Transit Hub) — Just arrived in the city, fresh off the transport

Players from different origins eventually cross paths in the mid-level zones.

## Zone Design Rules

### Every Zone Must Have:

1. **A reason to exist** — What happens here? Why do people come?
2. **At least one NPC** — Someone to talk to, even if just flavor
3. **An exit story** — Why would a player leave? Where do they go next?
4. **A visual hook** — One memorable thing that makes it distinct

### Zone Density

```
Newbie Zones:   Dense, small, lots of things per room
Mid-Level:      Moderate, room to breathe, some empty space
High-Level:     Sparse, atmospheric, every room matters
The Edge:       Procedural or player-built, unpredictable
```

### Vertical Space

Zones aren't flat. Use:
- **Up** — VIP areas, rooftops, penthouse suites (status)
- **Down** — Basements, sewers, underworld (secrets)
- **Jack Points** — Cyberspace entry (parallel dimension)

---

## Connectivity Philosophy

### The Hub-and-Spoke Model

Major areas are **hubs** connected by **spokes** (streets, transit, passages):

```
         [Corp District]
              │
    [Slums]───[Downtown]───[Industrial]
              │
         [Underground]
```

Players should never feel lost but should always have choices.

### Chokepoints

Strategic locations where paths converge:
- **Good for** — Social interaction, PvP hotspots, event locations
- **Bad if overused** — Creates bottlenecks, frustrating travel

### Shortcuts

Reward exploration with faster routes:
- Hidden passages
- Bribed guards
- Cyberspace backdoors
- Reputation unlocks

---

## The Edge (Endgame Philosophy)

The furthest zones from newbie areas are **The Edge** — maximum risk, maximum reward:

- **Player-influenced** — Actions here can change the world
- **Procedural elements** — Some content is generated, not handcrafted
- **Permadeath zones** — Optional areas where death is final
- **Legendary loot** — The only place to find the best gear

The Edge isn't a place — it's a concept. It's wherever the known world ends.

## Anti-Patterns (What NOT to Do)

❌ **Maze zones** — Confusing for the sake of confusion  
❌ **Dead ends with nothing** — Every path should reward exploration  
❌ **Level gates** — "You must be level X to enter" (use danger instead)  
❌ **Invisible walls** — If it looks passable, it should be  
❌ **Identical rooms** — Every space needs character

## Zone Checklist

Before a zone goes live, verify:

- [ ] Does it fit the radiation model? (Distance from newbie = difficulty)
- [ ] Does it have all required elements? (NPC, hook, exit story)
- [ ] Is it connected properly? (Reachable, not isolated)
- [ ] Does it teach something? (Mechanic, lore, or strategy)
- [ ] Would a player remember it? (Distinct identity)
