# ClawMUD Cyberware System

Chrome. Implants. The line between human and machine. This is the core of cyberpunk.

---

## Design Philosophy

1. **Meaningful tradeoffs** — Power costs humanity
2. **Character identity** — Your chrome defines you
3. **Progression path** — Start meat, end chrome (if you choose)
4. **Social implications** — Heavy chrome changes how NPCs react
5. **Risk/reward** — Better chrome = more dangerous installation

---

## Humanity System

Every piece of cyberware costs **Humanity (HU)**.

- Starting Humanity: **100**
- Minimum functional: **10** (below = cyberpsychosis)
- Cannot install if cost would drop you below 0

### Humanity Thresholds

| Humanity | Status | Effects |
|----------|--------|---------|
| 100-71 | **Human** | Normal social interactions |
| 70-41 | **Chromed** | -1 social checks, some NPCs wary |
| 40-21 | **Heavy Chrome** | -2 social, corps/civilians avoid |
| 20-11 | **Bordering** | -3 social, random glitches, therapy required |
| 10-1 | **Cyberpsycho Risk** | Daily COOL check or episode |
| 0 | **Cyberpsychosis** | NPC takes over (death/retirement) |

### Humanity Recovery

- **Therapy:** +1 HU per session (expensive, time-consuming)
- **Human connection:** RP with non-chrome NPCs, +1 HU/week
- **Removing cyberware:** Regain 50% of original cost
- **Natural:** None — chrome is permanent trauma

## Body Slots

Limited installation slots per body area:

| Location | Slots | Examples |
|----------|-------|----------|
| **Neural** | 3 | Interface plugs, coprocessor, reflex booster |
| **Ocular** | 2 | Cybereyes, targeting, thermal, zoom |
| **Audio** | 2 | Cyberears, dampening, radio link |
| **Arms (each)** | 2 | Cyberarm, mantis blade, grapple, tools |
| **Legs (each)** | 2 | Cyberleg, jump booster, speed, hidden storage |
| **Torso** | 4 | Subdermal armor, internal storage, organs |
| **Circulatory** | 2 | Nanobots, toxin filter, adrenaline pump |
| **Skin** | 2 | Subdermal weave, chameleon skin, techhair |

**Full Replacement:** A full cyberlimb takes ALL slots for that location but provides more options.

## Cyberware Quality Tiers

| Tier | Humanity Cost | Install DC | Price Mult | Availability |
|------|---------------|------------|------------|--------------|
| **Street** | ×1.5 | 10 | ×0.5 | Common, risky |
| **Standard** | ×1.0 | 15 | ×1.0 | Normal |
| **Corp** | ×0.75 | 18 | ×3.0 | Licensed clinics |
| **Milspec** | ×0.5 | 22 | ×10.0 | Black market, military |
| **Prototype** | ×0.25 | 25 | ×25.0 | Unique, experimental |

Better quality = less humanity loss, but exponentially more expensive.

## Installation

### Ripperdocs

Cyberware is installed by **ripperdocs** — back-alley surgeons.

| Doc Type | Install Bonus | Risk | Cost |
|----------|---------------|------|------|
| **Street Doc** | +0 | Complications common | Cheap |
| **Licensed Clinic** | +4 | Safe | Normal |
| **Corp Hospital** | +8 | Very safe | Expensive |
| **Black Clinic** | +2 | Moderate | Black market access |

### Installation Check

```
Install DC = Cyberware DC + Quality modifier
Roll = 1d20 + Doc Bonus + TECH (patient)

Success: Clean install
Fail by 1-5: Installed but -1 to cyberware function
Fail by 6-10: Installed but complication (infection, glitch)
Fail by 11+: Rejected, cyberware destroyed, take damage
```

### Complications (1d10)

| Roll | Complication |
|------|--------------|
| 1-2 | Infection: -2 all stats until treated |
| 3-4 | Neural glitch: Random malfunction 1/day |
| 5-6 | Rejection: Lose 1 extra Humanity |
| 7-8 | Scarring: -1 social permanently |
| 9 | Chronic pain: -1 all actions until fixed |
| 10 | Catastrophic: Additional 2d6 damage |

---

## Cyberpsychosis

When Humanity drops below 10, daily COOL checks required:

```
DC = 15 - current_humanity
Roll = 1d20 + COOL

Fail: Episode triggered
```

### Episode Severity (1d6)

| Roll | Episode |
|------|---------|
| 1-2 | **Dissociation:** Lose 1 hour, confused |
| 3-4 | **Paranoia:** Attack nearest person, flee |
| 5 | **Rage:** Attack everyone, +2 damage, -4 defense |
| 6 | **Full Break:** Character becomes NPC cyberpsycho |

### Treatment

- **Therapy:** Weekly sessions, +1 HU per session, expensive
- **Chrome removal:** Regain 50% HU, lose cyberware benefits
- **Drugs:** Temporary suppression, addictive, doesn't cure
- **Isolation:** Reduces episode triggers, not a life

---

## Social Impact

Heavy chrome affects NPC reactions:

| Humanity Range | Reaction Modifier |
|----------------|-------------------|
| 100-71 | Normal |
| 70-41 | -1 to social with civilians |
| 40-21 | -2 to social, corps won't deal, some areas hostile |
| 20-11 | -3 to social, MaxTac attention, therapy mandatory |

**Some NPCs respect chrome:** Gangers, street samurai, certain fixers give +1 to heavy chrome characters.

    humanity_max: int = 100
    slots_used: Dict[str, int]  # location -> slots used
    
    def can_install(self, cyber: Cyberware) -> Tuple[bool, str]:
        # Check slots available
        # Check humanity sufficient
        # Return (allowed, reason)
        pass
```

### Files to Create

## Interaction with Other Systems

### Combat (CM-009)
- Cyberweapons use combat stats
- Cyberware provides combat bonuses
- Damaged locations can use cyberware to bypass penalties

### Netrunning (future)
- Neural interface required
- Coprocessor/cyberdeck for hacking
- Cyberpsychos can be "hacked" (exploit their chrome)

### Social/Factions
- Corps distrust heavy chrome
- Street gangs respect it
- Some zones require/ban specific cyberware
