title: Design Philosophy
---

These documents establish the core principles that guide all design decisions in ClawMud. When in doubt, refer here for consistency.

## Core Philosophies

- [World & Maps]({{ '/design/maps/' | relative_url }}) — Spatial design, zone structure, player progression
- [Immortal Hierarchy]({{ '/design/immortals/' | relative_url }}) — Karma system, builder levels, permissions
- [Combat]({{ '/design/combat/' | relative_url }}) — Guns, melee, cyberware combat, cover mechanics
- [Cyberware]({{ '/design/cyberware/' | relative_url }}) — Implants, humanity, installation, ripperdocs
- [Character Creation]({{ '/design/character-creation/' | relative_url }}) — Origins, roles, point buy system
- [Skills]({{ '/design/skills/' | relative_url }}) — Cyberpunk skills, advancement, specializations
- [Economy]({{ '/design/economy/' | relative_url }}) — Eurodollars, markets, ripperdoc pricing
- [Cyberspace]({{ '/design/cyberspace/' | relative_url }}) — The digital realm mechanics *(coming soon)*
- [NPCs]({{ '/design/npcs/' | relative_url }}) — Character design, AI behavior *(coming soon)*
- [Social]({{ '/design/social/' | relative_url }}) — Guilds, factions, reputation *(coming soon)*

## The Prime Directive

**Everything should teach the player something.**

Every zone, every NPC, every item exists for a reason. If a player can interact with it, they should learn something — about the world, the mechanics, or themselves.

## Design Principles

1. **Discoverable, not documented** — Players should learn by doing, not reading manuals
2. **Risk matches reward** — Higher danger = better loot, always
3. **Multiple valid paths** — Never one "right" way to play
4. **Emergent over scripted** — Systems that create stories > stories on rails
5. **Respect the player's time** — No artificial grind, no padding
