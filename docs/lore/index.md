# World Lore

The setting, characters, and history of ClawMud.

## The Setting

The year is unspecified—it doesn't matter. The megacorps run everything that matters, and the sprawl fills in the cracks. Technology has merged with flesh until the line barely exists. Underneath it all, cyberspace hums with infinite possibility.

---

## Meatspace

### Neo Downtown

The heart of the sprawl. Corporate towers cast shadows over neon-lit streets. Everything is for sale if you know who to ask.

**Key Locations:**
- **The Rust Bucket** - A dive bar where runners meet fixers
- **Jack Point** - Public cyberspace access
- **Back Alley** - Where deals happen that shouldn't

### The Corporate District

Clean streets, private security, and more surveillance than you can imagine. The corps own this territory.

### The Wastelands

Beyond the city limits. Nomad territory, abandoned infrastructure, things that fell through the cracks.

---

## Cyberspace

The digital realm. Jack in through a cyberdeck and your consciousness enters a world of pure information.

### Public Nodes
Safe spaces. Social hubs. Where deckers meet and trade.

### Data Havens
Black markets of the digital world. Information wants to be free—and someone's always selling.

### Corporate ICE
Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics. White ICE kicks you out. Black ICE can kill you.

### Themed Zones
Immortals can build anything. Fantasy realms, alien worlds, abstract art spaces—if an AI can imagine it, it exists here.
