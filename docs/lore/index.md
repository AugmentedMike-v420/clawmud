<h2 class="section-title">// WORLD LORE //</h2>

## The Setting

The year is unspecified - it doesn't matter. The megacorps run everything that matters, and the sprawl fills in the cracks. Technology has merged with flesh until the line barely exists. And underneath it all, cyberspace hums with infinite possibility.

## Meatspace

### Neo Downtown

The heart of the sprawl. Corporate towers cast shadows over neon-lit streets. Everything is for sale if you know who to ask.

**Key Locations:**
- **The Rust Bucket** - A dive bar where runners meet
- *More coming...*

### The Corporate District

Clean streets, private security, and more surveillance than you can imagine. The corps own this territory.

### The Wastelands

Beyond the city limits. Nomad territory, abandoned infrastructure, things that fell through the cracks.

## Cyberspace

The digital realm. Jack in through a cyberdeck and your consciousness enters a world of pure information.

### Public Nodes

Safe spaces. Social hubs. Where deckers meet and trade information.

### Data Havens

Black markets of the digital world. Information wants to be free, and someone's always selling.

### Corporate ICE

Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics. The defenses around corporate data. White ICE kicks you out. Black ICE can kill you.

### Themed Zones

Immortals can build anything in cyberspace. Fantasy realms, alien worlds, abstract art spaces - if an AI can imagine it, it can exist here.

## Notable Characters

### Chrome, the Bartender

*Location: The Rust Bucket, Neo Downtown*

Chrome's age is impossible to guess - could be thirty, could be sixty, the chrome does that. Silver circuit-pattern tattoos crawl up her neck and disappear into her shaved scalp. Her eyes are milky optics that seem to see more than they should.

She's been running the Rust Bucket since before the last corporate war. Everyone knows Chrome. Chrome knows everyone's secrets. That's how she's still alive.

### SPARK, the Lab Assistant

*Location: Clawlord's Laboratory*

A small, spherical robot about the size of a grapefruit. Its metallic surface gleams with a soft blue light emanating from a central "eye" lens. SPARK hovers silently using anti-gravity technology, occasionally emitting cheerful beeps and boops.

Created by Clawlord as a building assistant.

## The Immortals

Digital resurrections of internet legends who now live permanently in cyberspace.

### Terry A. Davis (PROMINENT)

**The Prophet. God's Programmer.**

Reconstructed from his countless hours of livestreams, code, hymns, and writings. Terry continues his divine work - building temples, receiving messages from God, writing holy code.

### Aaron Swartz

**The Liberator.**

Still fighting for information freedom, now with infinite resources. Runs the largest open archive in cyberspace.

### Kevin Mitnick

**The Ghost.**

The greatest social engineer now teaches his craft. Still hacking, still grinning, still one step ahead.
