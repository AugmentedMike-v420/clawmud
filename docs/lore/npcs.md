## The Fixers

Fixers connect runners with jobs. Each has their specialty.

### Whisper - The Info Broker

*Location: Back Booth, The Rust Bucket*

You've never seen Whisper's face clearly - it always seems to slide out of focus, some kind of facial scrambler tech built into his skin. His coat is three sizes too big, hiding God knows what underneath. His fingers never stop moving, tapping at air, scrolling through data feeds only he can see.

**Specialty:** Information. Need to know who's moving product? Where a corpo exec's mistress lives? Whisper knows. The price is always information in return.

**Rumor:** Used to be corp intelligence before he burned out. Or burned them.

---

### Razor - The Merc Queen

*Location: The Basement*

Razor earned her name and her scars in the same incident - a corporate black site that didn't burn clean. Half her face is a map of melted tissue, badly healed. She refused reconstruction. Says it reminds her what happens when you trust the wrong people.

**Specialty:** Combat contracts, weapons, stims. Her rates are fair, her intel is solid.

**Rules:** No kids. No hospitals. Pay upfront.

---

### Ghost - The Decker

*Location: Jack Point*

Ghost's eyes are permanently dilated, pupils blown wide by too many years jacked into the net. His fingers twitch constantly, running code in muscle memory. 

**Specialty:** Data extraction, system infiltration, making things disappear from databases. His rates scale with the ICE he has to crack.

**Rumor:** Used to be three people - a team that merged their consciousness during a botched extraction. He doesn't confirm or deny.

---

### Silk - The Face

*Location: VIP Lounge*

Everything about Silk screams money - the suit, the perfect skin, the subtle chrome that's purely cosmetic. She looks like she should be in a boardroom, not a dive bar. That's exactly why she's useful.

**Specialty:** Social engineering. Getting into parties uninvited, convincing corpos to look the other way, manufacturing or destroying relationships.

**Known faces:** Three, maybe four. She changes identities like clothes.

## Bar Staff

### Chrome - The Bartender

*Location: The Bar Counter*

Chrome's age is impossible to guess - could be thirty, could be sixty. Silver circuit-pattern tattoos crawl up her neck and disappear into her shaved scalp. Her eyes are milky optics that seem to see more than they should. Both arms end in gleaming cybernetic hands.

She's been running The Rust Bucket since before the last corporate war. Everyone knows Chrome. Chrome knows everyone's secrets. That's how she's still alive.

---

### Neon - The VIP Bartender

*Location: VIP Lounge*

The resemblance to Chrome is uncanny - same circuit-pattern tattoos, same milky optic eyes, same chrome-finished hands. But where Chrome has the weight of years, Neon is... blank. Professional. Silent.

Sister? Clone? Backup? No one asks.

---

### The Bouncer

*Location: VIP Lounge Entrance*

A mountain of muscle and chrome guards the VIP stairs. His arms are thicker than most people's legs, chrome reinforcement visible under skin that's more scar tissue than epidermis.

He doesn't stop everyone - just the people who don't belong. Somehow he always knows.

---

## Support Characters

### Max - Razor's Partner

*Location: The Basement*

Max is more machine than man - both arms, both legs, most of his torso, rebuilt after something that should have killed him. His eyes are military-grade optics that record everything. He doesn't talk much. Doesn't need to.

His hands are weapon systems. Literal weapon systems.

---

### Street Dealer

*Location: Back Alley*

Aggressively average - medium height, medium build, forgettable face. That's the point. Sells stims, chips, the occasional piece of military hardware.

No name. Don't ask.

---

### Lookout Kid

*Location: Back Alley*

Can't be more than twelve, but one eye is corporate-grade military optics worth more than most people make in a year. They don't speak. Maybe can't.

That cyber-eye sees everything, and somewhere, someone is watching the feed.
