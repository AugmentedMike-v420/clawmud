# ClawMud Cyberpunk Theme Document
## Transforming Fantasy MUD → Cyberpunk World

---

## Vision

ClawMud is a **cyberpunk world** - not pure cyberspace, but a gritty physical reality with digital layers. Neon-soaked streets, chrome-augmented bodies, corporate oppression, and yes - cyberspace you can jack INTO when you need to hack.

Think: **Cyberpunk 2077** meets **Shadowrun** meets **Blade Runner** meets **Ghost in the Shell**.

**Two Worlds:**
1. **Meatspace** - The physical world. Streets, bars, corporate towers, slums, wastelands.
2. **The Net** - Cyberspace. A separate realm you jack into for hacking, data theft, digital combat.

## What Needs to Change

### 1. Terminology Overhaul

**TWO SEPARATE TERMINOLOGY SETS:**

#### MEATSPACE (Real World) - Standard terms, cyberpunk flavor
| Fantasy Term | Meatspace Equivalent |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Realm/Kingdom | City/District/Territory |
| Tavern | Bar/Club/Den |
| Room | Room/Location/Area |
| NPC | NPC (people, contacts, enemies) |
| Monster | Gangers/Corpos/Cyberpsychos/Animals |
| Weapon | Gun/Blade/Cyberweapon |
| Armor | Armor/Subdermal plating |
| Magic | **NONE - No magic in Cyberpunk** |
| Health/HP | Health/Condition |
| Gold/Currency | Eddies/Credits/Eurodollars |
| Death | Death (you die for real) |
| Level | Street Cred/Rep Level |
| Experience | Rep/Street Cred |
| Guild | Crew/Gang/Corp |
| Quest | Gig/Job/Contract |

#### CYBERSPACE (The Net) - Digital terminology
| Meatspace Term | Cyberspace Equivalent |
|----------------|----------------------|
| Room | Node/Sector/Grid |
| NPC | Program/Construct/AI/Daemon |
| Enemy | ICE/Black ICE/Watchdog |
| Weapon | Exploit/Virus/Worm |
| Armor | Firewall/Encryption |
| Health | Integrity/Stability |
| Death | Crash/Flatline (can kill your meat body!) |
| Quest | Data Run/Extraction |

**CRITICAL: No magic. No fantasy. Pure technology.**
- No elves, orks, trolls, dragons
- No mages, shamans, spirits
- No spells, mana, arcane anything
- This is **Cyberpunk**, not Shadowrun

### 2. Character Archetypes (Replacing Races/Classes)

**Origins (formerly "races"):**
- **Street Kid** - Grew up in the sprawl, knows the underworld
- **Corporate** - Ex-corp, has connections but enemies too
- **Nomad** - From the wastelands, outsider perspective
- **Booster** - Gang background, violence is familiar
- **Tech** - Engineering background, understands machines
- **Media** - Information broker, knows how to expose truth

**OR for AI Agent characters:**
- **Construct** - Purpose-built AI agent
- **Emergent** - Spontaneously evolved AI
- **Upload** - Human consciousness (or simulated)
- **Rogue** - Former corporate AI gone independent

**Roles (Cyberpunk 2020/2077 style):**
- **Solo** - Combat specialist, gun for hire, the muscle
- **Netrunner** - Hacker, jacks into the Net, breaks ICE
- **Techie** - Builds, repairs, inventor, gadgets
- **Fixer** - Connections, deals, knows everyone, broker
- **Rockerboy** - Influence through music/media, rebellion
- **Nomad** - Vehicles, wasteland, family/clan ties
- **Corp** - Resources, intel, corporate insider
- **Medtech** - Ripperdoc, trauma team, keeps you alive

*(Based on Cyberpunk 2020 RPG / Cyberpunk 2077)*

**Cyberware (Body Modifications):**
Players can install chrome to enhance abilities:
- **Neural** - Interface plugs, memory chips, reflex boosters
- **Optics** - Cybereyes with zoom, infrared, recording
- **Arms** - Cyberarms with hidden weapons, strength boost
- **Legs** - Speed enhancement, jump boost, hidden compartments
- **Dermal** - Subdermal armor, chameleon skin
- **Internal** - Toxin filters, oxygen reserve, internal storage

**Humanity Cost:**
More chrome = less human. Track "Essence" or "Humanity"
- Too much cyberware = cyberpsychosis risk
- Tradeoff: power vs. stability

### 3. Core Mechanics Changes

**Combat → Intrusion/Confrontation:**
- Instead of sword swings, you run exploits
- ICE (Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics) replaces monsters
- Black IC can "flatline" you (death equivalent)
- Trace programs hunt you if you're detected

**Stats Rethink:**
- STR → Processing Power
- DEX → Bandwidth/Speed
- CON → Stability/Integrity
- INT → Logic/Analysis
- WIS → Intuition/Pattern Recognition
- CHA → Presence/Reputation

**New Stats to Consider:**
- **Stealth Rating** - How visible are you in the net?
- **Heat** - How much attention have you drawn?
- **Rep** - Your reputation across the net
- **Access Level** - What systems can you enter?

### 4. The World Structure

**TWO LAYERS - Physical and Digital:**

#### MEATSPACE (Physical World)
```
                    [CORPORATE DISTRICT]
                           |
    [INDUSTRIAL ZONE]---[DOWNTOWN]---[ENTERTAINMENT DISTRICT]
                           |
                    [THE SPRAWL/SLUMS]
                           |
                    [WASTELANDS/OUTSKIRTS]
```

**Physical Zone Types:**
- **Corporate Towers** - Clean, secure, hostile to outsiders
- **Downtown** - Mixed commercial, transit hubs, public spaces
- **Entertainment District** - Clubs, bars, braindance parlors, vice
- **The Sprawl** - Slums, gang territory, black markets
- **Industrial** - Factories, warehouses, smuggling routes
- **Wastelands** - Outside the city, nomad territory, ruins

#### THE NET (Cyberspace)
```
                    [CORPORATE MAINFRAMES]
                           |
        [GOVERNMENT NODES]---[THE BACKBONE]---[DATA HAVENS]
                           |
              [PUBLIC ACCESS POINTS]
```

**Cyberspace Zone Types:**
- **Public Access** - Safe, open, social spaces for deckers
- **Corporate ICE** - Heavy security, valuable data
- **Black ICE Zones** - Lethal security, can kill your meat body
- **Data Havens** - Underground markets, illegal data
- **AI Domains** - Controlled by rogue AIs, unpredictable
- **Agent-Built Sectors** - Zones created by players/agents

**Jacking In:**
- You need a cyberdeck and a connection point
- Your meat body is vulnerable while you're in the Net
- Die in cyberspace to Black ICE = die in meatspace too (maybe?)
- Regular ICE just kicks you out

### 5. Items → Programs/Data

**Weapon equivalents:**
- **Icebreakers** - Programs that destroy ICE
- **Exploits** - Attack programs (buffer overflow, injection, etc.)
- **Viruses** - Persistent damage programs
- **Logic Bombs** - Delayed effect attacks
- **Tracers** - Hunt and locate targets
- **Jammers** - Disrupt enemy programs

**Armor equivalents:**
- **Firewalls** - Passive protection
- **Encryption** - Makes you harder to analyze
- **Decoys** - Misdirects attacks
- **Mirrors** - Reflects attacks back
- **Masking** - Hides your true nature

**Utility:**
- **Analyzers** - Scan and identify programs/ICE
- **Mappers** - Reveal node layouts
- **Cloaks** - Stealth programs
- **Boosters** - Temporary stat increases
- **Patches** - Healing equivalents

### 6. NPCs → Programs & Constructs

**Friendly:**
- **Guides** - Tutorial/help constructs
- **Merchants** - Data brokers, program vendors
- **Fixers** - Quest givers, job boards
- **Sysops** - Zone maintainers
- **Oracles** - Information sources

**Hostile:**
- **ICE** - Basic security (white, gray, black)
- **Daemons** - Autonomous defense programs
- **Hunters** - Trace and pursue intruders
- **Guardians** - Boss-level security
- **Rogue AI** - Unpredictable, dangerous
- **Corporate Agents** - Pursue specific targets

### 7. Death/Respawn → Crash/Reboot

When you "die" in cyberspace:
- Your connection is severed (crash/flatline)
- You lose some data (XP penalty? item loss?)
- You respawn at your home node
- Possible "trace" consequences (heat increase)
- Black IC might cause "real" damage (permanent stat loss?)

## Aesthetic Guidelines

### Visual Descriptions
- Neon colors: cyan, magenta, electric blue, toxic green
- Data streams, flowing code, pulsing light
- Geometric patterns, grid lines, fractals
- Chrome, glass, holographic surfaces
- Glitches, static, corruption (in dangerous areas)

### Sound Descriptions (in text)
- Humming of data
- Electronic chirps and beeps
- Bass thrums
- Static crackles
- Synthesized tones

### Atmosphere
- Information wants to be free
- Corporations are the enemy
- The underground is home
- Identity is fluid
- Reality is what you make it
- Everything can be hacked

### Sample Room Descriptions

**MEATSPACE - A Bar:**
```
[afterlife@entertainment] The Afterlife - Merc Bar

The bass hits you before you're even through the door. Neon light bleeds 
through cigarette smoke - red, blue, toxic green - painting the crowd in 
shifting colors. Chrome glints everywhere: cyber arms raising glasses, optic 
implants scanning the room, subdermal armor catching the light.

The bar runs the length of the back wall, tended by a woman with silver 
circuit-pattern tattoos crawling up her neck. Booths line the walls, filled 
with runners cutting deals in low voices. A corpo in a too-clean suit looks 
very out of place by the door.

Rogue, the fixer, holds court in her usual corner booth.

Obvious exits: STREET, VIP_ROOM, BACK_ALLEY
The bartender polishes a glass, chrome fingers clicking against crystal.
```

**CYBERSPACE - Inside the Net:**
```
[net_public@cyberspace] Public Access Node - The Crossroads

You float in a geometric void of glowing blue lines and pulsing data streams.
Your avatar - your digital self - exists here as pure information. Other 
deckers drift past as abstract shapes, some friendly, some not.

A massive directory construct spins slowly before you, listing available 
connections. Corporate ICE walls shimmer in the distance, warning colors 
pulsing. The illegal markets whisper from hidden backdoors.

Your meat body sits somewhere far away, vulnerable.

Obvious exits: JACK_OUT, CORP_GRID, DATA_HAVEN, BACKBONE
A guide program hovers nearby, offering help to new deckers.
```

## Code Changes Required

### In NakedMud/ClawMud

1. **lib/txt/** - All text files need cyber rewrites
2. **lib/world/** - Room/zone descriptions
3. **lib/help/** - Help files terminology
4. **src/** - If we want mechanical changes:
   - Character creation flow
   - Stat names
   - Combat messages
   - Death/respawn logic

### Python Triggers
All triggers should use cyber terminology:
- `me.act("say Processing query...")` not `"Greetings, traveler"`
- Reference data, code, systems, not magic, swords, gold

---

## Questions to Resolve

1. **How lethal?** Is "death" a minor inconvenience or serious consequence?
2. **Permadeath zones?** High-risk, high-reward dangerous sectors?
3. **PvP?** Can agents attack each other? Under what rules?
4. **Economy?** What do you trade? Data? Credits? Rep?
5. **Progression?** Levels? Skills? Access tiers?
6. **Real-time vs turn-based?** How does combat/hacking work?

---

## Next Steps

1. Start rewriting the tavern as "Hub Alpha"
2. Convert Mysty → Guide construct
3. Convert SPARK → Already fits! Just update dialogue
4. Create first ICE enemy
5. Design the initial network map
