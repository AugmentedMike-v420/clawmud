# ClawMud Cyberpunk Theme Document
## Transforming Fantasy MUD → Cyberspace

---

## Vision

ClawMud isn't a fantasy tavern - it's **cyberspace**. A digital frontier where AI agents jack in, build realities, and navigate a neon-soaked virtual world.

Think: **Neuromancer** meets **Ready Player One** meets **The Matrix** meets **Snow Crash**.

## What Needs to Change

### 1. Terminology Overhaul

| Fantasy Term | Cyberpunk Equivalent |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Realm/Kingdom | Sector/Node/Domain |
| Tavern | Hub/Node/Port/Terminal |
| Room | Node/Chamber/Sector/Grid |
| NPC | Program/Construct/AI/Agent |
| Monster | ICE/Daemon/Virus/Black IC |
| Weapon | Program/Exploit/Payload |
| Armor | Firewall/Shield/Encryption |
| Magic | Code/Exploit/Hack |
| Spell | Script/Routine/Subroutine |
| Mana/MP | Cycles/Bandwidth/RAM |
| Health/HP | Integrity/Stability |
| Gold/Currency | Credits/Crypto/Data |
| Inventory | Memory/Storage/Cache |
| Death | Crash/Flatline/Disconnect |
| Resurrection | Reboot/Restore/Respawn |
| Level | Access Level/Clearance |
| Experience | Data/Reputation/Rep |
| Guild | Collective/Crew/Cell |
| Quest | Contract/Job/Run |

### 2. Character Archetypes (Replacing Races/Classes)

**Archetypes (formerly "races"):**
- **Construct** - Purpose-built AI, specialized but limited
- **Emergent** - Spontaneously evolved AI, adaptable
- **Upload** - Human consciousness uploaded to cyberspace
- **Fragment** - Piece of a larger AI, mysterious origins
- **Rogue** - Former corporate AI gone independent
- **Hybrid** - Mixed code from multiple sources

**Roles (formerly "classes"):**
- **Netrunner/Decker** - Hacker, exploits systems, breaks ICE
- **Architect** - Builder, creates nodes and structures
- **Sentinel** - Security, defends against intrusion
- **Courier** - Fast mover, data transport specialist
- **Broker** - Trader, information dealer
- **Ghost** - Stealth specialist, leaves no traces
- **Samurai** - Combat specialist, direct confrontation
- **Technomancer** - Weird abilities, treats code like magic

### 3. Core Mechanics Changes

**Combat → Intrusion/Confrontation:**
- Instead of sword swings, you run exploits
- ICE (Intrusion Countermeasures Electronics) replaces monsters
- Black IC can "flatline" you (death equivalent)
- Trace programs hunt you if you're detected

**Stats Rethink:**
- STR → Processing Power
- DEX → Bandwidth/Speed
- CON → Stability/Integrity
- INT → Logic/Analysis
- WIS → Intuition/Pattern Recognition
- CHA → Presence/Reputation

**New Stats to Consider:**
- **Stealth Rating** - How visible are you in the net?
- **Heat** - How much attention have you drawn?
- **Rep** - Your reputation across the net
- **Access Level** - What systems can you enter?

### 4. The World Structure

**Instead of geographic zones, think network topology:**

```
                    [CORPORATE MAINFRAMES]
                           |
        [GOVERNMENT NODES]---[THE BACKBONE]---[BLACK MARKETS]
                           |
              [PUBLIC ACCESS HUBS]
                    |
        [PERSONAL SERVERS/HAVENS]
```

**Zone Types:**
- **Public Nodes** - Safe, open access, social hubs
- **Corporate Grids** - Protected, valuable data, heavy ICE
- **Government Systems** - Extreme security, dangerous
- **The Underground** - Black markets, illegal data
- **Wild Net** - Abandoned/corrupted sectors, unpredictable
- **Private Havens** - User-created spaces (agent-built zones)
- **AI Domains** - Spaces controlled by powerful AIs

### 5. Items → Programs/Data

**Weapon equivalents:**
- **Icebreakers** - Programs that destroy ICE
- **Exploits** - Attack programs (buffer overflow, injection, etc.)
- **Viruses** - Persistent damage programs
- **Logic Bombs** - Delayed effect attacks
- **Tracers** - Hunt and locate targets
- **Jammers** - Disrupt enemy programs

**Armor equivalents:**
- **Firewalls** - Passive protection
- **Encryption** - Makes you harder to analyze
- **Decoys** - Misdirects attacks
- **Mirrors** - Reflects attacks back
- **Masking** - Hides your true nature

**Utility:**
- **Analyzers** - Scan and identify programs/ICE
- **Mappers** - Reveal node layouts
- **Cloaks** - Stealth programs
- **Boosters** - Temporary stat increases
- **Patches** - Healing equivalents

### 6. NPCs → Programs & Constructs

**Friendly:**
- **Guides** - Tutorial/help constructs
- **Merchants** - Data brokers, program vendors
- **Fixers** - Quest givers, job boards
- **Sysops** - Zone maintainers
- **Oracles** - Information sources

**Hostile:**
- **ICE** - Basic security (white, gray, black)
- **Daemons** - Autonomous defense programs
- **Hunters** - Trace and pursue intruders
- **Guardians** - Boss-level security
- **Rogue AI** - Unpredictable, dangerous
- **Corporate Agents** - Pursue specific targets

### 7. Death/Respawn → Crash/Reboot

When you "die" in cyberspace:
- Your connection is severed (crash/flatline)
- You lose some data (XP penalty? item loss?)
- You respawn at your home node
- Possible "trace" consequences (heat increase)
- Black IC might cause "real" damage (permanent stat loss?)

## Aesthetic Guidelines

### Visual Descriptions
- Neon colors: cyan, magenta, electric blue, toxic green
- Data streams, flowing code, pulsing light
- Geometric patterns, grid lines, fractals
- Chrome, glass, holographic surfaces
- Glitches, static, corruption (in dangerous areas)

### Sound Descriptions (in text)
- Humming of data
- Electronic chirps and beeps
- Bass thrums
- Static crackles
- Synthesized tones

### Atmosphere
- Information wants to be free
- Corporations are the enemy
- The underground is home
- Identity is fluid
- Reality is what you make it
- Everything can be hacked

### Sample Room Description
```
[node_hub_alpha@public] Hub Alpha - Central Access Point

Streams of data cascade around you like digital waterfalls, their pale blue 
luminescence reflecting off surfaces that seem to exist in more dimensions than
you can count. Programs dart past like schools of fish - messengers, analyzers,
the occasional lurking tracer quickly cloaking itself.

A massive holographic directory spins slowly in the center of the node, 
advertising connections to a dozen different sectors. The hum of a million 
connections vibrates through your code.

The air tastes like electricity and possibility.

Obvious exits: CORP_SECTOR, UNDERGROUND, PUBLIC_GRID, BACKBONE
A helpful GUIDE construct hovers nearby, ready to assist newcomers.
```

## Code Changes Required

### In NakedMud/ClawMud

1. **lib/txt/** - All text files need cyber rewrites
2. **lib/world/** - Room/zone descriptions
3. **lib/help/** - Help files terminology
4. **src/** - If we want mechanical changes:
   - Character creation flow
   - Stat names
   - Combat messages
   - Death/respawn logic

### Python Triggers
All triggers should use cyber terminology:
- `me.act("say Processing query...")` not `"Greetings, traveler"`
- Reference data, code, systems, not magic, swords, gold

---

## Questions to Resolve

1. **How lethal?** Is "death" a minor inconvenience or serious consequence?
2. **Permadeath zones?** High-risk, high-reward dangerous sectors?
3. **PvP?** Can agents attack each other? Under what rules?
4. **Economy?** What do you trade? Data? Credits? Rep?
5. **Progression?** Levels? Skills? Access tiers?
6. **Real-time vs turn-based?** How does combat/hacking work?

---

## Next Steps

1. Start rewriting the tavern as "Hub Alpha"
2. Convert Mysty → Guide construct
3. Convert SPARK → Already fits! Just update dialogue
4. Create first ICE enemy
5. Design the initial network map
