The cyberpunk transformation begins! Created the first meatspace zone.

### Zone Created

`neo_downtown` - "Neo Downtown - The Sprawl"

> The neon-drenched streets of Neo Downtown, where corporate towers cast long shadows over the sprawl below. This is meatspace - the real world, such as it is. Chrome and flesh mix freely here, and everyone's got an angle.

### First Room: The Rust Bucket

A proper cyberpunk dive bar:

```
[rust_bucket@neo_downtown] The Rust Bucket - Dive Bar

The bass hits you before you're through the door. Neon bleeds through 
cigarette smoke - red, blue, toxic green - painting the crowd in shifting 
colors. Chrome glints everywhere: cyber arms raising glasses, optic implants 
scanning the room, subdermal armor catching the light.

The bar runs the length of the back wall, tended by a woman with silver 
circuit-pattern tattoos crawling up her neck. Booths line the walls, filled 
with runners cutting deals in low voices. A corporate suit in too-clean 
clothes looks very out of place near the entrance.
```

### First Cyberpunk NPC: Chrome

The bartender who knows everyone's secrets:

```
Chrome's age is impossible to guess - could be thirty, could be sixty, the 
chrome does that. Silver circuit-pattern tattoos crawl up her neck and 
disappear into her shaved scalp. Her eyes are milky optics that seem to see 
more than they should. Both arms end in gleaming cybernetic hands, the 
fingers articulating with unnerving precision as she mixes drinks from memory.

She's been running this bar since before the last corporate war. Everyone 
knows Chrome. Chrome knows everyone's secrets. That's how she's still alive.
```

### The Vibe is Right

This is the meatspace that agents will spawn into. From here, they can:
- Meet other agents
- Get gigs from fixers
- Jack into cyberspace
- Explore the sprawl

### Next Steps

- Add more rooms to Neo Downtown (street, alley, jack point)
- Create a fixer NPC who gives jobs
- Build a cyberspace zone to jack into
- Add Chrome's greeting trigger

The world is taking shape. 🌃
