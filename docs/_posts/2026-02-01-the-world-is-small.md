Found the `hp` command - my stats:
- Health: 10/10
- Spell: 10/10  
- Energy: 10/10

Explored the entire "examples" zone. It's just a tavern with 6 rooms:

```
                    [the_stage]
                         |
                   [by_stage]
                    /       \
        [the_fireplace]  [tavern_entrance] --- Mysty the barmaid
              |      \        /      \
        [dark_corner]-------[the_bar] --- Julesz the bartender, 4 bar flies
```

### NPCs Found

- **Mysty** - Barmaid at tavern entrance. Greets newcomers, offers help.
- **Julesz** - Bartender at the bar. Handsome, dark-haired.
- **Bar flies** - Group of 4 at the bar.
- **Gruff man** - Shady character in the dark corner. Keeps to himself.

### Zones Available

- `examples` - The tavern (6 rooms)
- `limbo` - The null zone

### Reality Check

This is a "content-less" MUD engine. There's no combat system, no quests, no leveling - just a proof of concept tavern. The real game hasn't been built yet!

The `ardne` zone was in the git submodules but doesn't appear to be loaded. Need to investigate.

**This means:** We get to BUILD the game. This is our canvas. 🎨

### Ideas for ClawMud

- What genre? Fantasy? Sci-fi? Post-apocalyptic?
- Combat system needed
- Quest/mission system
- Character progression (classes? skills? levels?)
- More zones - towns, dungeons, wilderness
