# CM-011: Character Creation System

**Type:** feature  
**Priority:** high  
**Status:** Design Complete  

## Summary
Design and implement a character creation system with cyberpunk origins (backgrounds) and roles (specializations). Players choose who they were and who they're becoming.

## Requirements

### Origins (6 backgrounds)
- **Street Kid** — Grew up in the gutters
- **Corporate Exile** — Fell from grace
- **Combat Veteran** — War survivor
- **Tech Prodigy** — Natural with machines
- **Nomad** — Road family, new to city
- **Media** — Information broker/journalist

Each origin provides:
- [ ] Starting stat bonuses
- [ ] Starting gear appropriate to background
- [ ] Starting eddies (varied by origin)
- [ ] Starting debt (most origins)
- [ ] A contact NPC
- [ ] Unique origin perk
- [ ] Starting location

### Roles (8 specializations)
- **Solo** — Combat specialist
- **Netrunner** — Hacker/grid runner
- **Tech** — Repair and crafting
- **Fixer** — Connections and deals
- **Medtech** — Medical expertise
- **Rockerboy** — Performer/influencer
- **Lawman** — Order enforcer
- **Exec** — Corporate power player

Each role provides:
- [ ] Primary skill bonus (+2)
- [ ] Secondary skill bonus (+1)
- [ ] Unique ability
- [ ] Advancement path

### Core Stats (4)
- BODY (HP, melee, carrying)
- REFLEXES (initiative, dodge, accuracy)
- TECH (cyberware, repair, hacking)
- COOL (crit, social, composure)

### Point Buy System
- [ ] 20 points to distribute after origin bonuses
- [ ] Stat range: 3-8 at creation
- [ ] Cost scaling (higher = more expensive)

### Character Customization
- [ ] Name selection
- [ ] Short description
- [ ] Optional: age, distinctive features, fashion

### Origin-Specific Tutorials
- [ ] Each origin gets tailored introduction
- [ ] Teaches core mechanics through origin lens

## Design Document
See: `/docs/design/character-creation.md`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All 6 origins fully specified
- [ ] All 8 roles fully specified
- [ ] Point buy system balanced
- [ ] Debt system documented
- [ ] Origin/role synergies identified
- [ ] Implementation data structures defined
- [ ] Integration points with other systems noted

## Dependencies
- CM-012 (Skills) — Origins/roles provide skill bonuses
- CM-013 (Economy) — Starting eddies, debt system
- CM-010 (Cyberware) — Some origins interact with chrome

## Notes
- No "bad" combinations — all origin/role pairings should be viable
- Avoid Cyberpunk 2077 IP (no V, no Night City, etc.)
- Quick creation flow — get players in-game fast
