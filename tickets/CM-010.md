# CM-010: Cyberware System

**Type:** feature  
**Priority:** high  
**Status:** In Progress  

## Summary
Design and implement a cyberware/implant system — the core mechanic that makes this a cyberpunk MUD.

## Requirements

### Cyberware Slots
- **Neural:** Interface plugs, reflex boosters, memory chips
- **Optics:** Cybereyes, targeting systems, low-light, zoom
- **Arms:** Cyberarms, mantis blades, gorilla arms, grapple
- **Legs:** Cyberlegs, jump boosters, speed enhancers
- **Torso:** Subdermal armor, internal storage, toxin filters
- **Circulatory:** Adrenaline boosters, nanobots, pain editors

### Humanity/Chrome Cost
- Each implant costs "Humanity" or "Essence"
- Too much chrome = cyberpsychosis risk
- Creates meaningful tradeoffs
- Ties into RP (how much of you is still human?)

### Core Mechanics
- [ ] Slot system (limited slots per body area)
- [ ] Humanity tracking
- [ ] Cyberpsychosis thresholds and effects
- [ ] Installation (ripperdocs, cost, risk)
- [ ] Quality tiers (street, standard, milspec, legendary)
- [ ] Maintenance/degradation (optional)

### Integration Points
- Combat bonuses (CM-009)
- Skill bonuses
- Zone access (some areas need specific implants)
- Social penalties (corps distrust heavy chrome)

## Design Document
See: `/docs/design/cyberware.md`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Cyberware design doc complete
- [ ] Slot system defined
- [ ] Humanity/cyberpsychosis mechanics documented
- [ ] Sample implants for each slot
- [ ] Implementation plan with data structures
- [ ] Reviewed and approved

## Notes
- Balance power vs humanity cost
- Should feel like meaningful character choices
- Reference: Cyberpunk RED, Shadowrun, but original
