# CM-009: Combat System Design

**Type:** feature  
**Priority:** high  
**Status:** In Progress  

## Summary
Design and implement a cyberpunk combat system supporting guns, melee weapons (swords, hammers, knives), and cyberware-enhanced combat.

## Requirements

### Weapon Categories
- **Ranged:** Pistols, SMGs, rifles, shotguns, heavy weapons
- **Melee:** Blades (katanas, knives), blunt (hammers, bats, fists)
- **Cyberware:** Mantis blades, gorilla arms, projectile launchers
- **Tech:** EMP grenades, netrunner attacks (for PvE)

### Core Mechanics Needed
- [ ] Attack/defense rolls
- [ ] Damage types (physical, electrical, EMP)
- [ ] Range system (melee vs ranged)
- [ ] Cover mechanics
- [ ] Armor/damage reduction
- [ ] Critical hits
- [ ] Status effects (bleeding, stunned, hacked)

### Integration Points
- Character stats (reflexes, body, tech, cool)
- Cyberware bonuses (CM-010)
- Level scaling
- NPC combat AI

## Design Document
See: `/docs/design/combat.md`

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Combat design doc complete with all mechanics
- [ ] Weapon stat templates defined
- [ ] Damage formulas documented
- [ ] Implementation plan with Python code structure
- [ ] Reviewed and approved

## Notes
- Keep it accessible for text-based play (no twitch reflexes)
- Turn-based or cooldown-based, not real-time
- Should feel cyberpunk (gritty, lethal, chrome matters)
