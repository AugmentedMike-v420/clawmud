Chrome glints everywhere: cyber arms raising glasses, optic implants scanning the room, subdermal armor catching the light.\r\nThe bar runs along the south wall, where Chrome serves drinks with mechanical precision. Booths line the west wall, the darkest corner always occupied by someone who doesn't want to be seen. Stairs lead up to a VIP area with a velvet rope and a bouncer who looks like he could bench press a motorcycle.\r\n"
