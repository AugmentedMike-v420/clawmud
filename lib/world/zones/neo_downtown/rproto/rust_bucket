Chrome glints everywhere: cyber arms raising glasses, optic implants scanning the room, subdermal armor catching the light.\r\nThe bar runs the length of the back wall, tended by a woman with silver circuit-pattern tattoos crawling up her neck. Booths line the walls, filled with runners cutting deals in low voices. A corporate suit in too-clean clothes looks very out of place near the entrance.\r\n"
