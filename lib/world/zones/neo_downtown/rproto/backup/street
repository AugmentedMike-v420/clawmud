Neon signs compete for attention: gambling dens, ramen joints, body mod clinics, places that don't advertise what they sell. The rain has stopped but the streets are still slick, reflecting the light show above in oily puddles.\r\nThe Rust Bucket's entrance is a reinforced door with no sign - if you don't know what it is, you're not meant to. Across the street, a food cart sells something that smells almost like real meat. A group of gangers in matching chrome implants eye passersby from the corner.\r\n"
