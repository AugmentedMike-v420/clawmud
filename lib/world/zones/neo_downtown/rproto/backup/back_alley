Fire escapes zigzag up the walls, and you can see movement in the shadows above - people living in the spaces between spaces.\r\nA dealer works the corner, wares hidden but available. Behind them, a heavy door leads to somewhere, but it's watched by a drone that tracks your movement.\r\nThis is where you go when you don't want to be seen. Of course, someone always sees.\r\n"
