Welcome to where the real business happens.\r\nThe basement is bigger than it should be - someone knocked through to the adjacent buildings years ago. Now it's a warren of rooms separated by hanging plastic sheets. Medical equipment here, weapons there, a makeshift chip lab in the corner. Everything you can't buy on the street, sold at prices that make your eyes water.\r\n"
