The real inventory is in the locked cabinet: data chips, credsticks, things people need to disappear.\r\nA panel in the floor looks newer than the rest. If you know what you're looking for, you can see the hinges.\r\nChrome's personal terminal sits in the corner, its screen dark but humming with standby power. You probably shouldn't be here.\r\n"
