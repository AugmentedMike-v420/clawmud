The booth is covered in graffiti, stickers for underground decks, and warnings about ICE in corporate systems. A holographic sign flickers: 'JACK IN - 5 CRED/HR - NO ILLEGAL ACTIVITY (wink wink)'.\r\nInside the booth, a padded seat faces a neural interface jack. The hardware is old but maintained - someone keeps this place running, probably for a cut of whatever gets moved through it. You can see the faint traces of old blood on the seat. Sometimes jacking in goes wrong. Sometimes it goes very wrong.\r\n"
