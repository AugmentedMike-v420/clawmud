It tracks movement, records, zooms - you can see the iris adjusting as it focuses on you.\r\nHow a street kid got that kind of chrome is a story no one tells. The surgery alone would have killed most adults. But here they are, silent and watchful, the dealer's early warning system.\r\nThey don't speak. Maybe can't. But that cyber-eye sees everything, and somewhere, someone is watching the feed.\r\n"
