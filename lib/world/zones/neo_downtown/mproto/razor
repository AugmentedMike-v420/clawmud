She refused reconstruction. Says it reminds her what happens when you trust the wrong people.\r\nShe runs the basement operation - weapons, combat stims, the occasional contract that doesn't ask for details. Her rates are fair, her intel is solid, and her rules are simple: no kids, no hospitals, pay upfront.\r\nThe massive chrome-heavy man beside her is Max - her partner, her muscle, her eyes when she's focused elsewhere. They communicate in glances and half-gestures, years of partnership condensed into shorthand.\r\n"
