His coat is three sizes too big, hiding God knows what underneath. His fingers never stop moving, tapping at air, scrolling through data feeds only he can see.\r\nStatic knows things. That's his trade. Need to know who's moving product through sector 7? He knows. Need to know where a corpo exec's mistress lives? He knows. The price is always information in return - Static collects secrets like others collect credsticks.\r\nThey say he used to be corp intelligence before he burned out. Or burned them. The story changes.\r\n"
