Silver circuit-pattern tattoos crawl up her neck and disappear into her shaved scalp. Her eyes are milky optics that seem to see more than they should. Both arms end in gleaming cybernetic hands, the fingers articulating with unnerving precision as she mixes drinks from memory.\r\nShe's been running this bar since before the last corporate war. Everyone knows Chrome. Chrome knows everyone's secrets. That's how she's still alive.\r\n"
