He sells stims, chips, the occasional piece of military hardware that fell off a transport. Nothing too exotic, nothing that would bring heat.\r\nHis eyes are always moving, checking the alley entrances, watching for badges or competitors. The kid with the cyber-eye is his early warning system - one twitch and he can be gone, inventory vanished into hidden pockets.\r\nHe doesn't give his name. You don't ask. That's how it works down here.\r\n"
