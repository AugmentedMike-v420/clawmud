His arms are thicker than most people's legs, chrome reinforcement visible under skin that's more scar tissue than epidermis.\r\nHe doesn't stop everyone - just the people who don't belong. Somehow he knows. Maybe facial recognition, maybe pure instinct honed by years of reading crowds. Either way, if he puts a hand on your chest, you stop. Everyone stops.\r\nA small earpiece connects him to Chrome downstairs. Her word is law here.\r\n"
